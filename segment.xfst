!
! This script creates a segmenter.
!
! We first analyze the input, then use a modified generator 
! that leaves the boundaries on the surface. 
!
! The result is likely to be ambiguous. There are two types of
! ambiguities that this fst generates. Firs is due to multiple morphs
! that may be used for the same function.
! For example, this automaton will give `oku-r' and `oku-r-lar'
! for segmentation of `okur'. The second one is due to the fact that 
! there are two ways to indicate third person plural verbal agreement
! either by a null morpheme (which is the case with `onlar kitap okur') 
! or an over morpheme -lar. This can be fixed in the segmenter below
! as well. However, for these cases, filtering the output is easy
! anyway.  One can check, whether the original string and the
! segmented string after removing the boundaries is the same or not. 
!
! The other, more genuine segmentation ambiguity occurs when the
! string can be segmented in two different ways. For example `evleri'
! will both  be segmented as `ev-leri' and `ev-ler-i'. Ambiguities
! that do not affect the segmentation aside, the first one has only 
! the third person plural possessive morpheme, while the
! second one have two, one plural marker and one accusative case marker
! (or third person singular possessive marker).
!
! The consecutive boundaries that may happen because of the null
! morphemes are removed.
