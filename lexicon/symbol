!
! This file contains a list of sybols, such as currency symbols or the
! symbols used in mathematics. Some of these symbols are also used as
! punctuation.
! The punctuation symbols should go into 'punctuation'
! We also have a file for emoticon, or simileys: 'emoticon'
!
! For now, we tag these as punctuation, but they should get their own
! tag, with possibly subcategories.
